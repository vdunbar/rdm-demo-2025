## Organizing your data

Research data benefit from standardized naming conventions and formalized directory structures.

UBC Library provides self guided resources on best practices, available at [here](https://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/plan/organize-your-data/).

UBC Library also covers these topics in their **Data Bites** workshop series. [Sign up here](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/calendar/vancouver?t=d&q=data%20bites&cid=7544&cal=7544&inc=0).
